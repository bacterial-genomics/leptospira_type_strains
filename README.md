# _Leptospira_ type strain work
This is a repository for summary data, scripts, and workflows to evaluate all species type strains in the bacterial genus _Leptospira_

## Background on _Leptospira_
### Taxonomy
- The first reported observation of _Leptospira_ (at the time not formally named but suggested as "(_?Spirochaeta_) _interrogans_") was [in 1907](https://doi.org/10.2307%2F4559008) by the American physician Dr. A. M. Stimson (sole author), who saw it in kidneys from a yellow fever patient.
- The effective publication describing this bacterial genus was [in 1917](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19868121/) by the Japanese bacteriologist Dr. Hideyo Noguchi (sole author).

### Genomics
- The first public complete assembly of _Leptospira_ [on NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000007685.1/) is from 2004 by the Sao Paulo state (Brazil) Consortium. The strain sequenced was _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar Copenhageni str. Fiocruz L1-130
- Unlike some taxa, the majority  (85%) of _Leptospira_ raw genome sequence data have corresponding assemblies [on NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Info&id=171&lvl=3&lin=f&keep=1&srchmode=1&unlock).
- [The genome]() consists of two circular chromosomes, roughly 4.6 Mbp in total size. For Illumina-only assemblies, 3.8 to 4.5 Mbp is a common size range observed from 85 to 120 contigs and 35% to 40% GC composition.

## Data stored here
- [XLSX file](https://github.com/bacterial-genomics/leptospira_type_strains/blob/main/type-strain-info/List%20of%20approved%20Leptospiraceae%20species.xlsx) listing of species type strains with several features for each:
    - effective publication year
    - 16S rRNA gene sequence locus tag
    - ppk1 gene sequence locus tag
    - RefSeq genome accession
    - taxonomic status
    - clade membership (i.e., pathogenic (P1, P2), saprophytic (S1, S2))
